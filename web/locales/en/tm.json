Two top layers and one horizontal shell are enough. You may want to print the top layer quite slowly to get smooth surfaces. If you use Simplify3D slicer, you will need to invoke \"Separate Connected Surfaces\" to get a correct print. Printing time for a 17 cm map with the base printed in two layers is around 3–4 hours.",
