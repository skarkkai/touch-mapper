Using Touch Mapper, you can easily create custom outdoor maps for any address of your choice. You can either print the map yourself at no charge using an embosser, a swell paper printer or a 3D printer, or you can order an affordable 3D print (a basic map for 35 euros, about USD40).",

Blind people probably need assistance from a sighted person to do this. Select \"Advanced options\" and then \"Print a part of multipart map\". In this mode, there will be no borders around the edges of a 3D print. Also, there appears arrow buttons for adjusting the selected area by 100% (that is, map's diameter) in each direction, which makes it easy to select adjacent areas for the maps.",

    "if_you_print_yourself": "If you print using your own 3D printer, use layer thickness of 0.25 mm or 0.3 mm. The base is 0.6 mm thick, and it's enough to print it in two layers. Two top layers and one horizontal shell are enough. You may want to print the top layer quite slowly to get smooth surfaces. If you use Simplify3D slicer, you will need to invoke \"Separate Connected Surfaces\" to get a correct print. Printing time for a 17 cm map with the base printed in two layers is around 3–4 hours.",

I created Touch Mapper after learning about the challenges faced by people who are blind or partially sighted when travelling independently, and realizing how 3D printing combined with freely available map data can help. I have integrated Touch Mapper with __startTag__Playful Pixels'__endTag__ 3D printing service to make getting high-quality maps as easy and affordable as possible.",
