Using Touch Mapper, you can easily create custom outdoor maps for any address of your choice. You can either order an affordable 3D print (basic map for 35 euros, about USD40), or 3D-print the map yourself at no charge.",

In this mode, there will be no borders around the edges of the map. Also, there appears arrow buttons for adjusting the selected area by 100% (that is, map's diameter) in each direction, which makes it easy to select adjacent areas for the maps.",

Two top layers and one horizontal shell are enough. You may want to print the top layer quite slowly to get smooth surfaces. If you use Simplify3D slicer, you will need to invoke \"Separate Connected Surfaces\" to get a correct print. Printing time for a 17 cm map with the base printed in two layers is around 3–4 hours.",
