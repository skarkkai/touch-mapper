Refuse too large map data size

Map https://test.touch-mapper.org/fi/map?map=B57bd2c8b2f3d765 says:
Major road Turunväylä, 8590 meters
From the center to the west part
Crosses east edge in the south and west edge near the center
But that's impossible, both by visual inspection, and because parts of the roads must exist near east edge or south-east corner since the road crosses east edge.
